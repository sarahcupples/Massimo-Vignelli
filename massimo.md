# Massimo Vignelli



## MODERNIST MASTER 

Massimo Vignelli is amongst the most important characters in design history. In a career spanning over 50 years, Vignelli’s resolute commitment to design enabled him to make vital contributions to the worldview of minimal design and the advancement of the design principles of the Modern Movement. His approach to Modernism combined European tradition with American pragmatism to create works which are still admired to this day.

Vignelli's design ethic has taught thousands of designers to see the impact of synthetic, simple forms as a reaction to visual noise, vulgarity, and disorder.  His graphics systems, in particular, house a functionality and utility to users which is unparalleled and still cater to users’ needs today.  Throughout his career he strived to create intellectually, visually powerful and, above all, timeless design.


## LIFE

Born January 10, 1931, Massimo had a complicated family life. The son of a pharmaceutical salesman and a seamstress, his parents' marriage fell apart and ended when he was only seven years old, setting him and his family outside the norm of Italian Catholic life. He acknowledged the hardships of his early years as lessons which influenced his style and approach to design throughout his entire career. In particular, he accredited his relationship with his aunt and mother as the inspiration for his pragmatism and confidence in his abilities, stating:

> They taught me to be respectful, to be neat, to put something away if I took it out, to talk and dress properly- not for others, but for myself. It was a fundamental attitude: not doing something for appearances, but doing it because it reflects who you actually are.
*—Jan Conradi, 2014 (Two Lives, One Vision)*

At the age of 14, Vignelli decided that he was to become an architect. Therefore, he left school at the age of 16 and sought out work as an architectural draftsman. What resulted was a series of short internships with some of the most revered and dynamic designers and architects of that time. The first of which was an internship in the office of the Castiglioni Architects in Milano. Vignelli was remarkably impressed at the possibility of working on a diverse range of projects in so many areas of design. He attributes this internship with helping him understand that to be able to design anything one must master a design discipline, as this is  essential on every task that a designer will do.

Vignelli also gained an internship under Franco Albini, a Neo-Rationalist architect and designer. Throughout his works, Albini instilled a reductive and extreme purity of expression which fuelled Vignelli's modern and minimalistic worldview and design ethic.

At 20 years old, Vignelli went on to study architecture at the Politecnico di Milano (1951-53) and later at the Università di Architettura, Venice (1953-57), where he met his future wife Lella Valle. The pair married and travelled to the United States in 1957, where Vignelli had been offered a fellowship from a silverware manufacturing company. However, while working there, he was offered a teaching role at the Institute of Design in Chicago, where he taught graphic design for a year (1958-59). The pair returned to Italy, and in 1965 Massimo became a founding member of the Unimark International Corporation.


## UNIMARK

Unimark International Corporation officially opened in January 1965, with Massimo Vignelli named as one of six vice presidents. Through Unimark, Vignelli wanted to grasp every opportunity to teach the design community the value of functional language. His modern visual language profoundly influenced the approach and work of Unimark, and his passion and unabating use of the Helvetica typeface helped pave the way for its universal recognition and widespread use.

Vignelli's ultimate aim for the company was that it be objective, to steer clear of emotion and focus on function in order to take a more systemic approach to visual identity. Which, at that time in the United States, was challenging to find within design. He desired that Unimark become an advocate of change, that in a rapidly changing world it could help drive design forward and improve the experience design provides for all users.

Unimark's first major project was to create a new identity system for Ford. Working on this project helped uncover one of Vignelli's central beliefs which would influence him for the rest of his life. He urged Ford to retain their logo as there was equity in it, and the best course of action would be to solely tidy it up and apply it to a new system. He went against the advice of almost everyone, including Paul Rand, who wanted to start afresh. Vignelli's stance to designers was:

> Do not deny history. American culture is based on novelty, on difference; Europeans are not interested in new ways as much as they are interested in refining a concept which has existed through the centuries. It is a continuing evolution, not a revolution. 
*—Jan Conradi, 2014 (Two Lives, One Vision)*

This proved to be a popular position with clients, and ultimately aided the further success and growth of the Unimark company.


## AMERICAN AIRLINES

In 1967, Massimo Vignelli fronted the design for the corporate identity of American Airlines.  Vignelli began this project with the intention of creating an identity that would be timeless, and he made every decision in accordance with this. For example, he chose to use Helvetica as he believed it "transcends subjectivity and searches for objective values, a typography that is beyond times." (Vignelli, 2015) What he produced was a system which was clean and straightforward. It was centred upon the values and standing of American Airlines, and for over 40 years the design was synonymous with quality and practical design.

The initial monogram simply consisted of two Helvetica uppercase As, one blue and one red. However, American Airlines insisted Vignelli incorporate some aspect of American symbolism. Staying true to the syntactics of the primary logo, he added a clean-cut, geometric eagle between the two As. Vignelli's approach was so remarkably minimal, and yet it was admired for encapsulating the essence and professionalism of American Airlines and their status as a pillar of aviation.


## KNOLL

In 1967 Bobby Cadwallader, part of the senior leadership at Knoll International, hired Vignelli to create a new graphics programme for Knoll. As successful as the original designs of Herbert Matter were, Vignelli's resulting designs which were based principally on a grid, were highly functional and generated a foundation for every plausible communication need. This included brochures, business cards and four-color advertisements for magazines such as Fortune and Vogue. His designs for Knoll became universally revered.

For example, his monumental 'Knoll' poster. Vignelli was of the opinion that a single word would be superior, and far more functional, to the design of the poster than any logo. He felt that the company did not need anything more to identify them, with no additional illustration or symbols needed. Therefore, the poster is of his Modernist style, and employs overlapping and slightly transparent letters in various different colours. This approach encapsulated Vignelli's bold and crisp style, and portrayed Knoll's identity perfectly.

Vignelli's approach to the branding and design of Knoll's programme avoided fashion and focused on function in order to create a design system which could endure. It provided the company with an international graphic identity which, as a result, became an industry standard.


## VIGNELLI ASSOCIATES

In April 1971 Vignelli resigned from Unimark and established Vignelli Associates with Lella, accomplishing their objective of bringing contemporary Italian design to the United States. The Vignelli's worked throughout every field of design and their refined, almost Minimalist taste brought them international acclaim. Massimo and Lella's harmonious partnership was fuelled by their shared belief that "Design is One" and that it can be applied to many different subjects, whether it be the likes of furniture, graphic or product design.

> Very often people think that Design is a particular style. Nothing could be more wrong! Design is a discipline, a creative process with its own rules, controlling the consistency of its output toward its objective in the most direct and expressive way. 
*—Massimo Vignelli, 2015 (The Vignelli Canon)*

The Vignelli's style was inherently Modernist, and they were insistent that a modernist philosophy of design could help build a better society. Their works were characterised by clear communication, logical functionality, the clever use of space and materials, and lasting quality.


## NEW YORK SUBWAY SYSTEM

With an increase in international design standards and the growing consciousness of 'good design', it was evident the New York subway system desperately needed a more practical navigational system and visual identity. The current system was an impenetrable confusion of interwoven lines, which led to substandard user experience. Therefore in 1972, after spending years developing a logical system for the MTA, Vignelli unveiled the official map of the New York subway system. 

The map gained a mixed reception. Many commuters were upset that the map ignored much of the city aboveground, removing many familiar elements of the cityscape. Rather than a modernist schematic layout, they had been expecting a geographically accurate map. On the other hand, the map was venerated by the design community and today is regarded as one of the most quintessential pieces in the history of graphic design.

The criticism, however, proved louder than the praise, and the map was replaced with a more accurate rendition of the subway system's layout in 1979. Vignelli blamed the failure of his design on the world's verbally oriented society.

However, Vignelli's iconic signage, which he developed alongside the map for the New York station, has remained unchanged to this day.


## CONCLUSION

In 2014, at the age of 83, Massimo Vignelli died, leaving behind a monumental legacy and contribution to the world of design. His advocacy of the virtues of rigor and minimal design has inspired generations and help usher in a new way of thinking. Along with his fellow design pioneers, Vignelli was helped lead the United States into its first modern era of design. And his seemingly limitless abilities enabled him to conceive some of the most successful and universally impactful design companies of that time, and his resultant work helped change the standard of design forever.

Before his death, his son Luca reached out to anyone his fathers' work may have touched or impacted, and the reaction was unprecedented. In particular, the words of Ivan Chermayeff speak to the testament of Vignelli's legacy:

> Massimo Vignelli was a lesson to all designers about the enduring value of being contemporary and forward-looking. [He] demonstrated his beliefs about good design consistently and his communications were a commitment that never faltered.
*—Ivan Chermayeff, 2014 (SEGD Article)*
